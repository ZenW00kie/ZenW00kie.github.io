                            I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://tsp.cs.tufts.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tufts Security & Privacy Lab</a> (Teaspoon Lab) studying computer security, focusing on medical devices and Industrial Control Systems. My research looks at how tools and processes to ensure security for critical infrastructure, such as healthcare and the energy grid, are used and can be improved. During my PhD, I've worked closely with device maufacturers and network operators to understand their operating environments and ensure my research can directly impact their work.

Sure, we need to be aware of and control the flow of information about ourselves online. My threat model accounts for this, and the benefits of sharing this information outweigh the cons.

                            Before embarking on my Ph.D., I wore several different hats in a
                            variety of industries. I've spent the past decade
                            working in various positions related to behavioural
                            science. I have experience in capital markets,
                            defence, and politics. Some highlights include:
                            co-founding a startup that developed technology
                            augmenting situational awareness for Army Special
                            Forces, studying portfolio manager behaviour at a
                            prominent hedge fund (before joining a portfolio
                            team), helping political campaigns with
                            microtargeting using digital and offline data,
                            and coordinating the cybersecurity for a
                            presidential campaign. I went to university with the
                            impression that politics was like the West Wing and
                            I wanted to be

                    My research focuses on the intersection of cybersecurity,
                    <a
                        href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >critical infastructure</a
                    >, and human factors. In particular I am particularly
                    interested in how to provide tools and processes to security personnel and ensure that security is a force multiplier to safety and reliability. While my career has been focused on providing data-driven recommendations to high-performance organizations, security has come up in one way or another. My initial foray into security professionally was when I was working with political campaigns, I was tasked with security operations as a sysadmin/the person with the most <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/24/programmers-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">neckbeard</a>. Later while on Wall St, I was investing in healthcare companies that underwent security incidents. As I observed this, the cogs in my head started to turn. Why is securing these types of systems difficult? What are the underpinning questions that impede secure-by-design systems?
                </p >
                <p>
                    A Ph.D. is about focusing on a <a href="https://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very narrow topic area</a>, and while some may think usable security for critical infrastructure is narrow, I focus further on two general security topics within this domain: threat modelling and vulnerability assessment. For reference, here is a inexhaustive list frameworks and standards I look at: NIST 800-53, <a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/nice-framework-resource-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NICE Framework</a>, ISO 27000, ISO 10073, AAMI TIR75, and ISO 24392.
                </p >
                <p>
                    This type of research has me using similar techniques, such as survey design and statistical methods, for example ordinal regressions, that I used to examine how various groups make decisions (like what messages resonated with voters when I worked in politics). While my PhD gives me a knowledge of security, I would describe myself as a behavioural scientist or operations researcher looking at people and process challenges within cybersecurity rather than a cybersecurity researcher looking at creating tools and processes to solve challenges they have expertise and experience in. That said, I fully immerse myself in the problem space by interning with cybersecurity companies, participating in cybersecurity training, and engaging deeply with the security community. One of the most helpful learning experiences I had when working with political campaigns was going out and knocking on doors to see how my model predictions fared up against what voters actually care about.

                </div>
                <p>
                    Threat modelling is a way to abstract a security review to focus on the design of a system rather than the nitty-gritty details and also to think about threats and mitigations on a higher level. Some of the questions I think about are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        How is threat modelling done in practice?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What are ways to make recommendations to users about threats and mitigations to consider based on their experience and the context of the system/deployment?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    My work on threat modelling is centred around how security professionals threat model, what are the barriers to adoption for threat modelling, and how we can formalize threat modelling.

                </div>
                <p>
                    Vulnerability assessment consists of figuring out the risk posed by a threat or vulnerability in isolation and in the context of the deployment of the vulnerable software. The questions I am looking to answer include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        What are the various ways we can assess vulnerabilities? Are there specific attributes considered by medical device manufacturers or medical providers?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How can we improve vulnerability communication?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Can we "pre-triage" vulnerabilities using a threat model, i.e., can I rank vulnerabilities affecting the different aspects of my system based on the importance of those parts?
                    </li>

                        </div>
                        <p>
                            When applying for academic jobs, you are required to provide statements on your research and teaching philosophies. Providing a general professional philosophy statement that drives my decision-making is essential. Maybe this is the self-centered Millennial in me that needs validation, or the influence of my mother who <a href="https://annebahrthompson.com/brand-citizenship-purpose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">helps brands find their purpose</a>.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Mission-Oriented</h3>
                        <p>
                            I've spent a fair amount of time working with the military and veterans in various organisations. <a href="https://wearefirstin.com/team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Renny McPherson</a>, a veteran and professional mentor, always talks to me about the importance of being driven by the mission. I've internalised this over the years and want to make sure that my work delivers on my personal mission <i>to enable operators to focus on their mission by <span>making security a force multiplier for safety and reliability</span></i>.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Tikkun olam</h3>
                        <p>
                            In Judaism, we refer to a concept called "tikkun olam," which literally means repairing the world. Over time, this has grown, and for many now signifies a calling to a higher purpose and to do good in the world. My hope is that my work positively impacts society by minimizing security risks.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Do no harm</h3>

                            I've been on the front lines of figuring out how to leverage social media to influence voters when I was working in politics. The weaponization of social media, especially by foreign threat actors, has motivated me to spend time thinking about my role in this, and I strive to ensure that my work does not cause undue harm, or at the very least that I acknowledge the potential for harm.

                        <h3>Good design is integral</h3>
                        <p>
                            One of my most influential mentors, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottriding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scotty Riding</a>, told me that good design begets adoption, and more importantly, lousy design will definitely kill it. He also introduced me to Ruby, whose design philosophy is to make programmers happy. While most of my software is written in Python, I consider this when designing APIs and User Interfaces.

                        <div class="section-title">
                            <h2>Design Inspiration</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            I want to acknowledge where the inspiration for my website's design comes from.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Fonts</h3>
                        <p>
                            My main text font is <a href="https://www.ibm.com/plex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IBM Plex&reg;</a>. I selected IBM Plex because of IBM's design goal of representing the medium between man and machine, which is similar to my goal of translating between technical and non-technical audiences. My headings use <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Hammersmith+One" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hammersmith One</a>, which is derived from the Johnston typeface (the font used by <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/suppliers-and-contractors/font-requests?intcmp=5840" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transport for London</a>) and a nod to my childhood taking the Tube.

                        <h3>Colour Palette</h3>
                        <div class="color-grid" style="margin-left: 40px;">
                            <div class="color-grid__swatch" style="background-color:#000000">&ensp;Black (#000000)</div>
                            <div class="color-grid__swatch" style="background-color:#ada8a8; color: #000000">&ensp;Warm Grey 40 (#ada8a8)</div>
                            <div class="color-grid__swatch" style="background-color:#ec6602">&ensp;Healthy Orange (#ec6602)</div>
                            <div class="color-grid__swatch" style="background-color:#FFC0CB; color: #000000">&ensp;Pink (#fc89ac)</div>
                            <div class="color-grid__swatch" style="background-color:#ffffff; color: #000000;">&ensp;White (#ffffff)</div>
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            My background colour is Black, a standard colour that best contrasts my text and pays homage to the beginning of my career, which I spent in the dark in a beleaguered attempt to minimize server exhaust heat.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            White is my primary text colour as it is clean and precise, while Warm Grey 40 is used for section headers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My favourite colour is orange, and I chose Healthy Orange from <a href="https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/company/brand" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Siemens Healthineers</a> to emphasize important ideas, delineate sections, and site navigation. The colour echoes my work with medical device manufacturers, and is associated with promoting good health (security and otherwise).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, my links are underlined in pink, used by <a href="https://www.westminster.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Westminster School</a>, the secondary school where I started rowing. The story behind the school using this colour is that Westminster and Eton, another prominent independent school in the UK, competed in a rowing race to wear red, representing the monarchy, in 1837. The Westminster eight won, but their uniforms had been dyed right before the race, and by the end, the dye had bled to pink. Because of the unexpected victory, the school decided pink must be lucky, and the colour was adopted. Since my time at Westminer, I've always thought of pink as a lucky colour.
