          <p>My research focuses on the intersection of security, <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors">critical infastructure</a> IT/OT networks, 
            and human factors. I am particularly interested in how we, as the security
            community, can provide a secure environment to operators so 
            that they can focus on the work that they need to do. When I worked on Wall 
            St, I was investing in healthcare companies that underwent security 
            incidents. As I observed this, the cogs in my head started to turn. 
            Why is securing these types of systems difficult? What are the underpinning 
            questions that impede this?
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal is to develop technology and data-driven processes & tools that protect critical systems, and to ease the
            security burdens faced by IT/InfoSec and OT teams, to focus on what they are experts on rather than worry about security.

            <h2>In a prior life</h2>
          </div>
          <p>
            Before Tufts, I wore several different hats in a variety of 
            industries. I've spent the past decade working in various positions 
            related to behavioral science. I have experience in capital markets, 
            defense, and politics. Some highlights include: co-founding a 
            startup that developed technology augmenting situational awareness 
            for Army Special Forces, studying portfolio manager behavior at a 
            prominent hedge fund (before joining a portfolio team), helping 
            political campaigns with digital analytics, and coordinating the 
            cybersecurity for a presidential campaign. I went to university with
            the impression that politics was like the West Wing and I wanted to 
            be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Lyman">Josh Lyman</a>
            . The reality was more like Veep, and I ended up as a junior 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Veep_characters">Kent
            Davison</a>. My undergraduate degree was in Government from 
            Georgetown, where I focused on financial securitization regulation 
            such as Dodd-Frank and the EU Capital Requirements Directives.
