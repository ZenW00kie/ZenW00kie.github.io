                </div>
                <p>
                    I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://tsp.cs.tufts.edu/">Tufts Security & Privacy Lab</a> (Teaspoon Lab) studying computer security, focusing on medical devices and healthcare settings. My research looks at how tools and processes to ensure security in healthcare are used and can be improved. During my Ph.D., I've worked closely with medical device companies and hospitals to understand their operating environments and ensure my research can directly impact their work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>NOTE</b>: You may be wondering, "Ron, there's a lot of personal information here. Aren't you worried about this being used for social engineering purposes?". Sure, that's definitely something we need to be aware of and control the flow of information about ourselves online. My threat model accounts for this, and for me, the benefits of sharing this information outweigh the cons. You can read about personal threat models and other interesting security things in my blog, <a href="https://security4humans.com">Security4Humans</a>.

                <!-- Purpose / Philosophy -->
                <div class="section-title">
                    <h2>Purpose</h2>
                </div>
                <p>
                    When applying for academic jobs, you are required to provide statements on your research and teaching philosophies. I believe providing a general professional philosophy statement that drives my decision-making is essential. Maybe this is the narcissistic millennial in me that needs validation, or the influence of my mother who <a href="https://annebahrthompson.com/brand-citizenship-purpose/">helps brands find their purpose</a>.
                </p>
                <h3>Mission-Oriented</h3>
                <p>
                    I've spent a fair amount of time working with the military and veterans in various organisations. <a href="https://wearefirstin.com/team/">Renny McPherson</a>, a veteran and professional mentor, always talks to me about the importance of being driven by the mission. I've internalised this over the years and want to make certain that my work delivers on my personal mission <i>to enable operators to focus on their mission by <span>making security a force multiplier for safety and reliability</span></i>.
                </p>
                <h3>Tikkun olam</h3>
                <p>
                    In Judaism, we refer to a concept called "tikkun olam," which literally means repairing the world. Over time, this has grown, and many Jews have felt a calling to a higher purpose and to work to do good in the world. My hope is that my work positively impacts society by minimizing security risks.
                </p>
                <h3>Do no harm</h3>
                <p>
                    Having started off working in politics, specifically campaigns, I was on the front-lines of figuring out how to leverage social media to influence voters. The weaponization of social media, especially by foreign threat actors, has caused me to spend time thinking about what my role was in this and I strive to ensure that my work does not cause undue harm, or at the very least that I acknowledge the potential for harm.
                </p>
                <h3>Good design is integral</h3>
                <p>
                    One of my most influential mentors, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottriding">Scotty Riding</a>, told me that good design begets adoption, but more importantly, bad design will definitely kill it. He also introduced me to Ruby, whose design philosophy is to make programmers happy. While most of my software is written in Python, I consider this when designing APIs and User Interfaces.

                </div>
                <p>
                    Before embarking on my Ph.D., I wore several different hats in a
                    variety of industries. I've spent the past decade
                    working in various positions related to behavioral
                    science. I have experience in capital markets,
                    defense, and politics. Some highlights include:
                    co-founding a startup that developed technology
                    augmenting situational awareness for Army Special
                    Forces, studying portfolio manager behavior at a
                    prominent hedge fund (before joining a portfolio
                    team), helping political campaigns with
                    microtargeting using both digital and offline data,
                    and coordinating the cybersecurity for a
                    presidential campaign. I went to university with the
                    impression that politics was like the West Wing and
                    I wanted to be
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Lyman"
                        >Josh Lyman</a
                    >. The reality was more like Veep, and I ended up as
                    a junior
                    <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Veep_characters"
                        >Kent Davison</a
                    >. My undergraduate degree was in Government from
                    Georgetown, where I focused on financial
                    securitization regulation such as Dodd-Frank and the
                    EU Capital Requirements Directives. If you want to

                    <h2>Design Inspiration</h2>
                </div>
                <h3>Fonts</h3>
                <p>
                    I want to acknowledge where the inspiration for my website's design comes from. My main text font is <a href="https://www.ibm.com/plex/">IBM Plex&reg;</a>. I selected IBM Plex because of IBM's design goal of representing the medium between man and machine, which is similar to my goal of translating between technical and non-technical audiences. My headings use <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Hammersmith+One">Hammersmith One</a>, which is derived from the Johnston typeface and a nod to my childhood taking the Tube.
                </p>
                <h3>Colour Palette</h3>
                <div class="color-grid" style="margin-left: 40px;">
                    <div class="color-grid__swatch" style="background-color:#000000">&ensp;Black (#000000)</div>

                    <div class="color-grid__swatch" style="background-color:#FFC0CB; color: #000000">&ensp;Pink (#fc89ac)</div>
                    <div class="color-grid__swatch" style="background-color:#ffffff; color: #000000;">&ensp;White (#ffffff)</div>
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>
                    My background colour is Black, a standard colour that best contrasts my text and pays homage to the beginning of my career, which I spent in the dark in a beleaguered attempt to minimize server exhaust heat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    White is my primary text colour as it is clean and precise, while Warm Grey 40 is used for section headers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My favourite colour is orange, and I chose Healthy Orange from <a href="https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/company/brand">Siemens Healthineers</a> to emphasize ideas that are important, delineate sections, and site navigation. The color echoes my work with medical device manufacturers and that it is associated with promoting good health (security and otherwise).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, my links are underlined in pink, used by <a href="https://www.westminster.org.uk/">Westminster School</a>, the secondary school where I started rowing. The story behind the school using this colour is that Westminster and Eton, another prominent independent school in the UK, competed in a rowing race to wear red, representing the monarchy, in 1837. The Westminster eight won, but their uniforms had been dyed right before the race, and by the end, the dye had bled to pink. Because of the unexpected victory, the school decided pink must be lucky and the colour was adopted.

            <h2>Research Overview</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            My research focuses on the intersection of cybersecurity,
            <a
                href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors"
                >critical infastructure</a
            >, and human factors. In particularI am particularly
            interested in how to provide tools and processes to security personnel and ensure that security is a force multiplier to safety and reliability. While my career has been focused on providing data-driven recommendations to high-performance organizations, security has come up in one way or another. My initial foray into security professionally was when I was working with political campaigns, I was tasked with security operations as a sysadmin/the person with the most <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/24/programmers-price">neckbeard</a>. Later while on Wall St, I was investing in healthcare companies that underwent security incidents. As I observed this, the cogs in my head started to turn. Why is securing these types of systems difficult? What are the underpinning questions that impede secure-by-design systems?
        </p >
        <p>
            A Ph.D. is about focusing on a <a href="https://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/">very narrow topic area</a>, and while some may think usable security for critical infrastructure is narrow, I focus on two general security topics within this domain: threat modeling and vulnerability assessment. Threat modeling is a way to abstract a security review to focus on the design of a system, rather than the nitty-gritty details, and think about threats and mitigations on a higher-level. Vulnerability assessment consists of figuring out the risk posed by a threat or vulnerability in isolation and in the context of the deployment of the vulnerable software. For reference, here is a inexhaustive list frameworks and standards I look at: NIST 800-53, <a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/nice-framework-resource-center">NICE Framework</a>, ISO 27000, ISO 10073, AAMI TIR75, and ISO 24392.
